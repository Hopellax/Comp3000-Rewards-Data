# Comp3000- Rewards Data
Final year project- Hope Tremlett 

## What inspired me to create this project? 
I wanted to create this project to awareness of how companies are using our data
As not many people read the T&Cs so are not aware of how there data online is being used by companies and when technology and social media usage is growing at exponential rate I think it is something that is important. Individuals should have freedom and control over there informatation.

## What is my project?
My project is a platform where individuals can become more aware of how companies are using there data and exactly what data is being shared. 
It is also a way for individuals to gain/profit from there information rather than just large companies benifiting, Individuals using my site will have complete freedom and control over what information they are sharing.
